# TBR Change Log

## Release 0.0.1
Unsurprisingly, the firat release!  Contains all the basic functionality ported from the [original GTK project.](https://github.com/Bwian/tbr_gtk)

## Release 0.0.2
Changed API to encapsulate the processing functionality in its own class (Processor).  Functionality now initialised by a simple instance method rather than the previous class method.
